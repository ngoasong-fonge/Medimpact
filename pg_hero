The instructions above are based on the official installation procedure.
You don't mention which operating system you want to install PgHero. In this recipe, we are using CentOS 8 (we strongly recommend that you don't use CentOS 6 because it was deprecated last month) for the PgHero server and as you mentioned CentOS 6 for Postgres 9.6.
Let's install the repository and then install PgHero:
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/pghero.repo https://dl.packager.io/srv/pghero/pghero/master/installer/el/8.repo
yum -y install pghero
Let's setup a basic configuration. Adjust the DATABASE_URL accordingly.
pghero config:set DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:secretpassword@10.20.30.40:5432/bench
pghero config:set PORT=3001
pghero config:set RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=disabled
Starting the PgHero service:
pghero scale web=1
Check if the service is running:
curl -v http://localhost:3001/
In order to access PgHero from another machine, use a webserver that proxy the PgHero service. We are using Nginx.
Installing Nginx:
yum -y install nginx
Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and change location to:
    location / {
    proxy_pass   http://localhost:3001;
    }
Start the service:
systemctl start nginx
Check PgHero from your browser (such as http://10.2.3.4/ where 10.2.3.4 is the IP address of your PgHero server). If you want to restrict access, add a basic authentication with the following configuration:
pghero config:set PGHERO_USERNAME=tangoe
pghero config:set PGHERO_PASSWORD=secret
Restart the service:
systemctl restart pghero
If you have some issue, you can check the PgHero logs:
pghero logs
PgHero requires pg_stat_statements to monitor the queries. In order to use this Postgres extension, you have to install postgresql96-contrib, add the following configuration in your postgresql.conf and execute CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements in the database you are monitoring.
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.track = all
This change requires a Postgres restart:
service postgresql-96 restart
and create the extension:
bench=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION
Let us know how it goes.
