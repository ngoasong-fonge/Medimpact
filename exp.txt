Please create the tables exposures_by_cycle_period_schema and task_edited_schema in the standalone Postgres in prod and try loading these files
 
Both of them have the '|' delimiter
 
not the comma
 
"The one that is 113KB is task_edited and the other one is exposures_by_cycle_period. Both are using the piping operator as the delimiter "
 
COPY exposures_by_cycle_period_schema FROM '/path/to/exposures_by_cycle_period_file' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER;

COPY task_edited_schema FROM '/path/to/task_edited_file' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER;

psql -U your_username -d your_database -f exposures_by_cycle_period_schema.sql
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f task_edited_schema.sql
